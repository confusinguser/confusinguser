## Welcome to my profile 👋
I am a soon-to-be CS student who loves to code (when life allows). I'm always looking for new ideas for things to collaborate on, so if you have something in mind, please tell!

Also, if you have any questions you think I may be able to answer, I'd love to help.

i use arch btw 😎

## ⚡️ Fun fact
I love physics. I would have picked an education in it if programming hadn't been so much fun!

Also: I am currently on a hunt for good desktop tools in my everyday life. Everything from desktop environments to browsers to command-line tools. So if you have a good recommendation, I'd love to hear it :)
